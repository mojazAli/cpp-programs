/* In the function definition void print(char str[]);
str is just a pointer to the first element of the array,
not the complete array itself.

It's equivalent to writing:
void print(char *str);

Both mean the same thing â€” a pointer to a char.
The array itself is not copied or recreated; 
only the address is passed. 

This is why changes made to the array inside the 
print() function would affect the original array in main(). */
